# Introduction

## Jito Restaking

[Jito (Re)staking] is a multi-asset staking protocol for node consensus networks. The protocol tokenizes staked assets as vault receipt tokens (VRT) for enhanced liquidity and composability. Node consensus networks can use Jito Restaking to easily customize staking parameters, and economic incentives to tailor their security and tokenomics.

## NCN Overview

## What is a Node Consensus Network (NCN)?

A Node Consensus Network (NCN) on Jito Restaking is simply a distributed network that validates and confirms information.

- Node: A piece of software running the required protocols as specified by the node consensus network.
- Node Consensus Network (NCN): A set of nodes running software for the same network, working together to achieve consensus and provide services.
- Operator: An entity that manages one or more nodes in the node consensus network.

## What Can You Create as an NCN?

NCN design encompasses a wide range of possibilities, covering any off-chain service that can be validated on-chain. This flexibility empowers NCN developers to craft custom validation mechanisms tailored to the specific needs of their services. The sole requirement is that some form of proof for the off-chain service's execution must be submitted on-chain to facilitate its validation.

Examples of NCNs include:

- Blockchains
- Cross-chain bridges
- Co-processor networks
- Interoperability solutions
- Applications
- Solver networks
- Oracle networks
- And more!
