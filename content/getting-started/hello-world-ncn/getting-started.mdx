# Getting started

## Hello World NCN

This tutorial will guide you through building a Hello World NCN (Node Consensus Network) on Jito Restaking. 
This introductory example will help you understand the fundamental concepts of NCN development and how it interacts with the Jito Restaking ecosystem.

## Overview

The Hello World NCN is a simple implementation that demonstrates the core mechanics of how NCNs operate within the Jito Restaking framework. 
This example serves as an educational foundation that illustrates both the infrastructure setup and operational flow of a basic NCN.


### By Jito Restaking:

1. Register all components

    - Registering NCN in the Jito Restaking Protocol
    - Registering Operators who will perform work
    - Registering Vault that delegate assets to operators, establishing the economic security model

2. Opt-in all components

    - Activating the registered components to participate in the network
    - Establishing the connection between different entities in the ecosystem

3. Delegate the asset from Vault to Operator

    - Creating the economic relationship between `Vaults` and `Operators`
    - Establishing the stake that secures the network and incentivizes honest behavior

### NCN Program:

The NCN program demonstrates the core workflow:

    - **Admin creating messages** that need to be processe by Operators

        - Defining the work that requires consensus
        - Initiating the consensus process through message broadcasting

    - **Operators responding to messages** and submitting signed responses

        - Performing the requested validation or computation work
        - Cryptographically signing their responses to ensure accountability
    
    - **Program verifying the operator's work** through on-chain validation

        - Ensuring the correctness of operator submissions
        = Providing transparent verification that can be audited by all participants
