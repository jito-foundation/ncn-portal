# Jito Restaking

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of setting up a Node Consensus Network (NCN) with Jito Restaking, with detailed explanations for each step.

## Register All Components

Before Hello World NCN can function, you need to register three main component types: the NCN itself, Operators who perform working, and Vaults that provide economic security through asset delegation.

### NCN Registration

The NCN (Node Consensus Network) is the core application that defines the consensus rules and coordinates the work operators.

#### Create NCN Admin keypair

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with ncn:1
mkdir -p credentials/ncn
mv ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json ./credentials/ncn/
```

This step creates a new keypair for the NCN admin with a vannity address that starts with "ncn:1" for easier identification. 
The keypair is then stored in a dedicated credentials directory.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need SOL tokens to pay for transaction fees. Use the [Solana Faucet] to get some tokens for testing.

#### Initialize NCN

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn initialize \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/ncn/ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json
```

This command initializes Hello World NCN on the Solana blockchain using the Jito Restaking CLI. 
It creates the necessary on-chain state to represent Hello World NCN in the Jito Restaking ecosystem.

After successful initialization, you'll receive Hello World NCN's address: 

Ex: zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM


### Operators Registration

Operators are the entities that perform working and participate in the consensus process within Hello World NCN.

#### Create Operators Admin Keypair

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with ope:1
mkdir -p credentials/operator
mv opeKDrPSPhLYFFRpsPTLU6o86f4AFcFvNMRvbdifhvq.json ./credentials/ope/
```

Similar to the NCN keypair, this creates a vanity address starting with "opt:1" for Hello World operator admin, making it easier to identify in transaction and logs.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Remember to fund this address with SOL using the [Solana Faucet]
>
> [Solana Faucet]: https://faucet.solana.com/

#### Initialize Operator

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli restaking operator initialize 1000 \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/operator/opeKDrPSPhLYFFRpsPTLU6o86f4AFcFvNMRvbdifhvq.json
```

This command initializes an Operator account with a capacity of 1000 OPERATOR FEE BPS. 
The capacity represents the maximum amount of stake this operator can accept from vaults. 
After initialization, three operator accounts are created:

Ex:
- Operator 1: 6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj
- Operator 2: DqwU1gHAN55PJWX25Kvopkny2ENddCjWdqX68VEWPLQg
- Operator 3: 9sMvk2pvMnPusPZWuEim5dp6JPvfM5KKmLjgRV4uw61z

### Vault Registration

Vaults hold and delegate assets to operators, providing economic security to the network.

#### Create SPL token

```bash
spl-token  create-token
```

This creates a new SPL token that will be used by Hello World vault. In a production environment, this might be an exsting token with real economic value.

Ex SPL-Token created: 5Xk7TaAWWxCTiW1TsM4JVJkxqzFwbTAG1SBMWPfwMwT


#### Create Vault Admin Keypair

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with vau:1
mkdir -p credentials/vault
mv vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json ./credentials/vault/
```

This creates a vanity address starting with "vau:1" for Hello World vault admin, making it easier to identify in transactions and logs.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Remember to fund this address with SOL using the [Solana Faucet]
>
> [Solana Faucet]: https://faucet.solana.com/

#### Initialize Vault

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    --keypair ./credentials/vault/vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' 
    vault vault initialize '5Xk7TaAWWxCTiW1TsM4JVJkxqzFwbTAG1SBMWPfwMwT' 1000 1000 1000 9
```

This command initializes a vault with the following parameters:

- It uses SPL token (5Xk7TaAWWxCTiW1TsM4JVJkxqzFwbTAG1SBMWPfwMwT) as the supported token
- Sets **DEPOSIT_FEE_BPS** of 1000
- Sets **WITHDRAWAL_FEE_BPS** of 1000
- Sets **REWARD_FEE_BPS** 1000
- Sets **DECIMALS** 9

After initialization, the following addresses are created:

Ex:

VRT Token: 7Xe8hbtYDh1H4NeLDoG23gvcyeGnJCbmwobvbCwbsjtp

Vault: 4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA


## Opt-in Phase

After registering components, they need to opt into relationships with each other. 
This creates the necessary connections between NCN, Operators, and Vaults.

### NCN Opt-ins

#### NCN to Operator Connections

First, we need to initialize the state that connects the NCN with each Operator.

##### Initialize NCN Operator State

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking ncn initialize-ncn-operator-state \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/ncn/ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json
```

This command creates the initial state connecting your NCN with Operator 1. 
The NCN admin account is used to sign this transaction, establishing a relationship between the NCN and the operator.

Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, creating connections between your NCN and all three operators.

##### Warm Up NCN Operator State

After initialization, the connections need to be "warmed up" or activated.

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking ncn ncn-warmup-operator \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/ncn/ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json
```

This command activates the connection between the NCN and Operator 1, allowing the operator to participate in the NCN's consensus process. 
The NCN admin signs this transaction.

Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, activating all three connections.

#### NCN to Vault Connection

The NCN also needs to establish a connection with the Vault that will be delegating assets to the Operators.

##### Initialize NCN Vault Ticket

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking ncn initialize-ncn-vault-ticket \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/ncn/ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json
```

This command initializes the connection between your NCN and the Vault, creating the necessary on-chain state for the relationship.
The NCN admin signs this transaction.

##### Warm Up

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking ncn warmup-ncn-vault-ticket \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/ncn/ncnnteNRPccbg5mpwuJbzmBvVexHcoDWmZnLKybr8XA.json
```

This command activates the connection between the NCN and the Vault, allowing the Vault to delegate assets to Operators participating in this NCN. 
The NCN admin signs this transaction.

### Operator Opt-ins

Operators also needs to establish connections with both the NCN and the Vault.

#### Operator to NCN Connections

##### Warm Up

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking operator operator-warmup-ncn \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/operator/opeKDrPSPhLYFFRpsPTLU6o86f4AFcFvNMRvbdifhvq.json
```

This command activates the connection from the Operator's side, confirming that Operator 1 is willing to participate in your NCN's consensus process. 
The operator admin signs this transaction.

Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, confirming all three operators' participation.

#### Operator to Vault Connections

Operators also need to establish connections with the Vault to receive delegated assets.

##### Initialize Operator Vault Ticket

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking operator initialize-operator-vault-ticket \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/operator/opeKDrPSPhLYFFRpsPTLU6o86f4AFcFvNMRvbdifhvq.json
```

This command initializes the connection between Operator 1 and the Vault, creating the necessary on-chain state for the relationship. 
The operator admin signs this transaction.
Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, initializing connections between all three operators and the Vault.

##### Warm Up Operator Vault Ticket

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking operator warmup-operator-vault-ticket \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/operator/opeKDrPSPhLYFFRpsPTLU6o86f4AFcFvNMRvbdifhvq.json
```

This command activates the connection between Operator 1 and the Vault, allowing the operator to receive delegated assets from the Vault. 
The operator admin signs this transaction.
Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, activating connections between all three operators and the Vault.

### Vault Opt-ins

Finally, the Vault needs to establish connections with both the NCN and the Operators.

##### Vault to NCN Connection

###### Initialize Vault NCN Ticket

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    vault vault initialize-vault-ncn-ticket \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/vault/vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json
```

This command initializes the connection between the Vault and the NCN, creating the necessary on-chain state for the relationship. 
The vault admin signs this transaction.

###### Warm Up Vault NCN Ticket

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    vault vault warmup-vault-ncn-ticket \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    'zSy3NQbg13YaKVNu2zh6cZ15VtQyMeQWXc1dzzxx6LM' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/vault/vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json
```

This command activates the connection between the Vault and the NCN, allowing the Vault to delegate assets to Operators participating in this NCN. 
The vault admin signs this transaction.

##### Vault to Operator Connections

Before delegating assets, the Vault needs to prepare the token infrastructure.

###### Create Associated Token Account (ATA)

```bash
spl-token create-account 5Xk7TaAWWxCTiW1TsM4JVJkxqzFwbTAG1SBMWPfwMwT
```

This creates an associated token account for your SPL token, which will be used to hold tokens before they are delegated.

###### Mint Supported Token

```bash
spl-token mint 5Xk7TaAWWxCTiW1TsM4JVJkxqzFwbTAG1SBMWPfwMwT 3000
```

This mints 3000 tokens to your associated token account. In a production environment, you would already have these tokens from another source.

###### Mint VRT

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli vault vault mint-vrt 4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA 3000 0
```

This command mints Vault Restaking Tokens (VRTs), which represent the tokens being delegated to the Vault.


##### Initialize Operator Delegation

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    vault vault initialize-operator-delegation \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/vault/vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json
```

This command initializes the delegation from the Vault to Operator 1, creating the necessary on-chain state for the delegation. 
The vault admin signs this transaction.

Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, initializing delegations to all three operators.

##### Delegate To Operator

###### Operator 1

```bash
./jito-restaking-cli \
    vault vault delegate-to-operator \
    '4wmTjgjB4SDgh4mxUtmpYhoGqFi9ECNZmdmuEH7K99JA' \
    '6BeXz72E9yn8JgkfzjiPdsnaE8PppbdpKTGDi7H7bsZj' \
    100 \
    --rpc-url 'https://api.devnet.solana.com' \
    --keypair ./credentials/vault/vauBPs8vKk3tdqYkTji15xvLvDrkdowFvS4F3RapmBN.json
```

This command actually delegates 100 tokens from the Vault to Operator 1. 
This delegation provides economic security to the network and allows the operator to participate in the consensus process. 
The vault admin signs this transaction.

Similar commands are run for Operators 2 and 3, delegating 100 tokens to each operator.
