## Operator Registration Procedures

<Callout type="warn">
    The keypair (default Solana config) utilized for CLI operations will be designated as the administrator for the operator account and will be required for all subsequent instructions.
</Callout>

### Operator Account Initialization

This procedure establishes an Operator account within the Jito Restaking program, which serves as the primary account for registration with Network Compute Nodes (NCNs) and Vaults.

#### Parameters:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="OPERATOR_FEE_BPS">
        Fee ( in basis points ) taken from TipRouter rewards each epoch for operating the NCN - the rest of the rewards go to the vaults
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Command:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking operator initialize <OPERATOR_FEE_BPS>
```

#### Post-Execution

Record the Operator account address generated by this command for subsequent use.

<Callout type="warn">
    Important: 
    
    Submit the operator account address to Jito immediately for registration in the Tip Router NCN.
</Callout>


### Voter Administrator Configuration

This procedure designates a new keypair as the voter administrator, which will be used in the Tip Router Operator client to sign transactions for the Tip Router NCN.

#### Parameters:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="OPERATOR">
        The previously generated operator account address
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="NEW_ADMIN">
        The public key of the designated administrator
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="--set-voter-admin">
        Flag to designate the wallet as a voter administrator
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Command:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking operator operator-set-secondary-admin \
    <OPERATOR> \
    <NEW_ADMIN> \
    --set-voter-admin
```

<Callout type="info">
    Additional sub-administrator roles for the Operator account may be configured according to [Restaking documentation](../basics/operator). 
    These roles can be assigned to any Solana address, including keypairs, multisignatures, or program-owned addresses. 
    However, the voter administrator should specifically be a keypair due to the frequency of transaction signing.
</Callout>

### Operator Fee Configuration

<Callout type="info">
    Note: 
    
    Fee modifications are only effective when implemented before the snapshot.
    Modifications made after the snapshot will not take effect until the subsequent epoch's snapshot.
</Callout>

#### Parameters:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="OPERATOR">
        The operator account address
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="OPERATOR_FEE_BPS">
        The operator fee expressed in basis points
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Command:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli \
    restaking operator operator-set-fees \
    <OPERATOR> \
    <OPERATOR_FEE_BPS>
```
