## Overview

This is a basic version of the Tip Router Operator Client. 
It will allow Operators to ensure their node setups are correct and capable of participating in the Tip Router NCN. Right now, the client will: 

    1. Create a snapshot of the final slot of the previous epoch
    2. Create a tree of all validators and their stake accounts from that slot 
    3. Create a merkle root representing the tree and submit a memo transaction 
    4. Wait for the next epoch and continue this process indefinitely

Additional features will be added in the coming weeks as we prepare for launch on Jan 28th, but as long as your node is capable of submitting the memo transaction with the correct data, it will be able to run the full client.

Once you have successfully run this, make sure your node is registered with the NCN and vaults: 

[Tip Router Vault and Operator Registration](./vault-and-operator-registration)

## Node Requirements

- Node running mainnet Solana Validator service (does not need to be voting or expose RPC API)
- Known working versions: v2.1+ 
- CPU: less than 50% utilization on host machine
- Disk: Standard validator storage + ~500GB for snapshots (~100GB per snapshot)
- If additional storage is too much, can increase full-snapshot-interval-slots to store fewer total snapshots, as long as (maximum_snapshots_to_retain * snapshot_interval_slots) > 432000. 
- Network: Standard validator connectivity
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 12+ (others work, just need to adjust install commands)
- Solana keypair with enough SOL to pay for the memo transactions
- Running Telegraf pointed to Jito metrics server
