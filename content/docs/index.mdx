## NCN Overview

### What is a Node Consensus Network (NCN)?

A Node Consensus Network (NCN) on Jito Restaking enables developers to build decentralized services on Solana with customized verification mechanisms for off-chain activities. 
Each NCN consists of two main components: on-chain programs that handle verification and an off-chain network of Operators who perform the actual work.

These Operators execute specific tasks and submit proof of their work to the on-chain programs. 
The tasks themselves can originate from multiple sources: directly through on-chain contracts, through off-chain communication channels with Operators, or via specialized task aggregation systems.

NCN developers have complete flexibility in designing both the off-chain execution process and the on-chain verification mechanisms to suit their specific requirements:

- When Operators successfully complete their assigned tasks, the NCN can automatically distribute rewards to incentivize continued participation.
- If Operators act maliciously or submit incorrect information, the NCN can automatically slash their delegated stake and remove them from the network, maintaining system integrity.

### Core Components

When building an NCN, you'll work with these fundamental components:

- **Node**: A piece of software running the required protocols as specified by the node consensus network.
- **Operator**: An entity that manages one or more nodes in the network.
- **Service Requests**: Information that needs to be validated (e.g., DePIN device responses, asset price data, Solana Epoch snapshots).
- **Operator Responses**: The output of operators' off-chain work, typically compressed or hashed for on-chain storage.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Your designed system for operators to agree on the correct result.

## Customizable Elements

As an NCN developer, you have flexibility in how you implement:

- **Time Span**: You can define your own cycle timing independent of Solana epochs or other external timeframes.
- **Response Collection**: Design your own data structures for gathering and processing operator responses.
- **Verification Logic**: Create custom rules for what constitutes valid consensus.
- **Reward and Slashing Mechanisms**: Determine how operators are incentivized and penalized.

### What Can You Create as an NCN?

NCN design encompasses a wide range of possibilities, covering any off-chain service that can be validated on-chain. 
This flexibility empowers NCN developers to craft custom validation mechanisms tailored to the specific needs of their services. 
The sole requirement is that some form of proof for the off-chain service's execution must be submitted on-chain to facilitate its validation.

Examples of NCNs include:

- Blockchains
- Cross-chain bridges
- Co-processor networks
- Interoperability solutions
- Applications
- Solver networks
- Oracle networks
- And more!
