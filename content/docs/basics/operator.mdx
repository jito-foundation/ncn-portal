## Overview

### The Operator Account:

- Stores global metadata for a specific operator.
- Tracks the relationship between the operator and other NCN components (e.g. Vaults, NCNs).
- Manages administrative roles, including adding/removing support for NCNs and Vaults.

### Key functionalities include:

- Admin Role Management: Allows for delegating responsibilities to specialized admin roles.
- Operator Fee Management: Tracks fees charged by operators.
- NCN and Vault Indexing: Maintains counts of linked NCNs and Vaults for efficient indexing.
