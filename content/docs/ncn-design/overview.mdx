It is one of typical NCN design (Onchain NCN Program), so every NCN does not have to follow this design.

## Onchain NCN Program


    <Callout>
        NCN consisits of several components:
        
        - Pricing
        - Snapshot
        - Core Logic     
        - Reward Payment
    </Callout>

### Pricing

#### Tracked Mints

Register all vault's [support token] mint account that is associated with NCN.
Permissionless Cranker can [initialize] and [register] through Jito Tip Router Program.

##### TrackedMints

#### Weight Table

Determines the relative weight of assets (supported_mints) deposited in all the Vaults associated with NCN.
Permissionless Cranker can initialize `WeightTable` each epoch through [`initialize_weight_table`] instruction on Jito Tip Router Program and NCN admin update it.

##### WeightTable

| slot_created        | u64               | Slot weight table was created.                       |
| table               | [WeightEntry; 32] | The weight table.                                    |

| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| mint                | Pubkey      | The supported mint account pubkey in the vault.            |
| weight              | u128        | Usually price of the asset.                                |

| slot_updated        | u64         | The slot that weight entry is updated.                     |


    <Callout>
        Weight is flexible, if NCNs want to give one asset more "weight" over others, they can increase its value relative to the others.

### Core Logic

This is the essence of the NCN, where Node Operators post data on chain that proves they did their job, and the NCN can run actions based on those results.

#### Keeper

Keeper can publish some data into on-chain with consensus.


### Rewards Payment

Based on the operators who successfully performed the last step, the NCN calculates payments for the Operators and their Vaults, and distributes payments pro-rata according to their stake weight.

In progress

## Node Operator Client

This is the core off-chain logic of the NCN. It will run some arbitrary computation, and post some data on chain to a custom instruction, signing the transaction with the operator keypair.

Sample Node Operator Client:

- [solana-merkle-root-uploader](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana/blob/837300fa58cb450e041443bafc6e21a7ee8f15b7/tip-distributor/src/bin/merkle-root-uploader.rs)
- [stakenet-keeper](https://github.com/jito-foundation/stakenet/blob/master/keepers/stakenet-keeper/src/main.rs)

## Permissionless Cranker

For all of the permissionless operations that need to occur on a regular cycle, we need a client that is continually executing instructions.
