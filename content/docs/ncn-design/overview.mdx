description: Understanding the technical architecture and components of Node Consensus Networks

It is one of typical NCN design (On-Chain NCN Program), so every NCN does not have to follow this design.

## On-Chain NCN Program

    NCN consisits of several components:
        
    - <a href="./pricing" target="_blank">Pricing</a> - Define Supported Token and Weight of Supported Token
    - <a href="./snapshot" target="_blank">Snapshot</a> - Taking snapshot of Vault, Operator, Operator Stake Weight
    - <a href="./core-logic" target="_blank">Core Logic</a> - Define Consensus Mechanism
    - <a href="./reward-payments" target="_blank">Reward Payments</a> - Define Reward Payments


## Node Operator Client

This is the core off-chain logic of the NCN. 
It will run some arbitrary computation, and post some data on chain to a custom instruction, signing the transaction with the operator keypair.

Sample Node Operator Client:

- <a href="https://github.com/jito-foundation/stakenet/blob/master/keepers/stakenet-keeper/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Stakenet Keeper</a>


## Permissionless Cranker

For all of the permissionless operations that need to occur on a regular cycle, we need a client that is continually executing instructions.

Sample Permissionless Cranker:

- [Jito Tip Router Keeper](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-tip-router/blob/master/cli/src/keeper/mod.rs)
