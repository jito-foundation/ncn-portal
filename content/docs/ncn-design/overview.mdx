description: Understanding the technical architecture and components of Node Consensus Networks

It is one of typical NCN design (On-Chain NCN Program), so every NCN does not have to follow this design.

## On-Chain NCN Program

    NCN consisits of several components:
        
    - <a href="./on-chain-ncn/pricing" target="_blank">Pricing</a>
        - Defines supported tokens and their respective weights in the network, determining how different assets are valued within the NCN ecosystem.
    - <a href="./on-chain-ncn/snapshot" target="_blank">Snapshot</a>
        - Captures the current state of Vaults, Operators, and Operator Stake Weights at specific intervals to establish consensus baselines.
    - <a href="./on-chain-ncn/core-logic" target="_blank">Core Logic</a>
        - Implements the fundamental consensus mechanisms that govern how nodes participate and validate output within the network.
    - <a href="./on-chain-ncn/reward-payments" target="_blank">Reward Payments</a>
        - Manages how rewards are calculated and distributed to participating operators, vaults and stakers based on their contributions to the network.


## Node Operator Client

This is the core off-chain logic of the NCN. 
It will run some arbitrary computation, and post some data on chain to a custom instruction, signing the transaction with the operator keypair.

Sample Node Operator Client:

- <a href="https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana/blob/master/tip-distributor/src/bin/merkle-root-uploader.rs" target="_blank">Solana Merkle Root Uploader</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/jito-foundation/stakenet/blob/master/keepers/stakenet-keeper/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Stakenet Keeper</a>


## Permissionless Cranker

For all of the permissionless operations that need to occur on a regular cycle, we need a client that is continually executing instructions.

Sample Permissionless Cranker:
