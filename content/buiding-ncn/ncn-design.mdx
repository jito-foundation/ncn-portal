# NCN Design

It is one of typical NCN design, so every NCN does not have to follow this design.

## Onchain NCN Program

NCN Program consisits of several components:

- [Pricing](./pricing.md)
- [Snapshot](./snapshot.md)
- [Core Logic](./core-logic.md)
- [Reward Payment](./reward-payments.md)

## Operator Client

This is the core off-chain logic of the NCN. It will run some arbitrary computation, and post some data on chain to a custom instruction, signing the transaction with the operator keypair.

Sample Node Operator Client:

- [solana-merkle-root-uploader](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana/blob/837300fa58cb450e041443bafc6e21a7ee8f15b7/tip-distributor/src/bin/merkle-root-uploader.rs)
- [stakenet-keeper](https://github.com/jito-foundation/stakenet/blob/master/keepers/stakenet-keeper/src/main.rs)


## Permissionless Cranker

For all of the permissionless operations that need to occur on a regular cycle, we need a client that is continually executing instructions.
