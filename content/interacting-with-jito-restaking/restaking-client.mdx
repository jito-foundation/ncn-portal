# Restaking Program

The Restaking program is primarily for initializing NCNs and Operators, managing NCN authorities, and registering relationships between NCNs, Operators, and Vaults. 

## NCN

### Initialize NCN

You can initialize your NCN through the restaking program:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn initialize
```

There are several things one can do after registering an NCN:

- Add and remove support for operators participating in the NCN operator set.
- Add and remove support for vaults.
- Add and remove support for slashers
- Delegate funds sent to the NCN from rewards, airdrops, and other sources.


### Initialize NcnOperatorState

NCN can have multiple Operators, each NCN Operator state stored on `NcnOperatorState` account. Once created, the NCN and operator can both warm-up and cooldown the state to show support for each other.

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn initialize-ncn-operator-state <NCN> <OPERATOR>
```

### Ncn warmup/cooldown Operator

NCN can wamup/cooldown relationship with Operator.

Warmup:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn ncn-warmup-operator <NCN> <OPERATOR>
```

Cooldown:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn ncn-cooldown-operator <NCN> <OPERATOR>
```

### Operator warmup/cooldown NCN

Operator can wamup/cooldown relationship with NCN.

Warmup:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn operator-warmup-ncn <NCN> <OPERATOR>
```

Cooldown:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn operator-cooldown-ncn <NCN> <OPERATOR>
```

### Initialize NCNVaultTicket

NCN can also have multiple Vaults, this ticket represents the relationship between an NCN and a Vault. It is created by the NCN to opt in to work with a Vault.

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn-vault-ticket initialize <NCN> <VAULT>
```

### Warmup/Cooldown NCNVaultTicket

NCN can wamup/cooldown relationship with Vault.

Warmup:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking ncn warmup-ncn-vault-ticket <NCN> <VAULT>
```

## Operator

### Initialize Operator

Operators are entities responsible for running NCN software.
You can initialize Operator through the restaking program:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking operator initialize <OPERATOR_FEE_BPS>
```

Argument

- OPERATOR_FEE_BPS: The operator fee in basis points

### Initialize OperatorVaultTicket

Operator can associate with multiple Vaults, this ticket represents the relationship between an Operator and a Vault.

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking operator initialize-operator-vault-ticket <OPERATOR> <VAULT>
```

### Warmup/Cooldown OperatorVaultTicket

Operator can warmup/cooldown relationship with Vault.

Wamup:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking operator warmup-operator-vault-ticket <OPERATOR> <VAULT>
```

Cooldown:

```bash
jito-restaking-cli restaking operator cooldown-operator-vault-ticket <OPERATOR> <VAULT>
```
